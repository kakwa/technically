# Obsolete Tech In A Modern Age

## Something Is New Again

One of my pet peeves is to bring new life into old hardware.
Here, I'm not thinking in a retro-computing kind of way, software is not exactly fine wine in my opinion: it doesn't age well.
Also, old software tend to be isolated in its own bubble, amusing, but unless you are [G.R.R. Martin rocking along WordStar 4.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5REM-3nWHg), that's not really useful.

I prefer the challenge of installing modern software that can actually talk to the outside, and actually do something useful.
It will not run a k8s cluster, but generally these old machines generally still have enough humff for light weight dedicated usecases like:

- Spotify/Webradio Receiver/MPD servers hooked to old analog Hi-Fi Systems.
- Basic (Static) Hosting
- Test Machines
- Firewalls/Routers

## The Little Server That Could (not)

Enters the Sun v100, the entry level server from 2001 sold by Sun Microsystems.

It boasts impressive specs such as:
- 2x 80GB IDE Hard Drives
- No GPU whatsover (not great for IA I guess :p)
- 2GB RAM (if maxed out)
- ~500MHz Sparc CPU
- two 100Mbits/s NICs
- LOMlite Management over Serial

In truth, this beast is a little asthmatic, but I find the Sparc CPU interesting, particularly for testing endianess and alignment issues.

I bought this v100 about 15 years ago secondhand, but in truth, never did something really useful with it.
This thing is simply a bit too big and too loud. But let's try to change that.
